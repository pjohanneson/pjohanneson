# Hi, I’m Patrick.

I've been developing custom WordPress code for a while now (since WPMU got rolled into core and called Multisite, if that means anything to you). I'm starting to really like [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/); so far I've convered [the Evans Theatre's website](https://evanstheatre.ca/) to use it.

I also write [science fiction, fantasy, and weird-tinged literature](https://patrickjohanneson.com/fiction/), [take photos (mostly after dark)](https://patrickjohanneson.com/category/photos/), and I teach judo.

You can find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/patrickjohanneson.com/), [Mastodon](https://mstdn.ca/@pjohanneson), or on [my site](https://patrickjohanneson.com/).
