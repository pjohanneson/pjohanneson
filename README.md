# Hi, I’m Patrick.

I've been developing custom WordPress code for a while now (since WPMU got rolled into core and called Multisite, if that means anything to you). I also write science fiction, fantasy, and weird-tinged literature, and I teach judo.

You can find me on [Twitter/@pjohanneson](https://twitter.com/pjohanneson) or on [my site](https://patrickjohanneson.com/).
